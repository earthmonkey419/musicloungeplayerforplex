Plex client wrapper for MusicLounge.

Layered search and mood-bucket matching follow RiderMusic's proven
pattern exactly (see RIDERMUSIC-PROJECT-SYNOPSIS.md): literal artist
match first, then literal track-title match, then Plex's fuzzy hub
search as a last resort -- preserving fuzzy matching for genuinely
vague queries (the mood pills) while fixing the "search for one
artist, get a loosely related one instead" problem hub search has on
its own.

    real-world testing found two root-cause bugs in the original

    1. Artist match used section.searchArtists(title=query), trusting
       Plex's server-side title filter -- RiderMusic instead fetches
       ALL artists (no title kwarg) and filters client-side by
       substring, which is what actually works reliably.
    2. Title match used section.searchTracks(title=query, ...) --
       plain title= does not do a substring/contains match. The fix
       is the `title__icontains` filter operator, which does. This
       alone explains "the firstborn" returning nothing (partial
       phrase match) while "blind lemon jefferson" (matching a full
