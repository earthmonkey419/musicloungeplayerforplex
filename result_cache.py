Player -- in-process TTL cache for search/mood result pools.

Ported from RiderMusic's proven implementation. Exists because
building a mood-bucket pool from live Plex means one query per
matching genre tag -- RiderMusic measured a broad bucket like "rock"
taking ~25 seconds cold on a real library (60+ sequential Plex
queries). Without caching, every mood-pill tap would pay that cost
again.

NOTE: this is a plain in-process dict, assumes a single gunicorn
worker (mlplayer's ecosystem.config.cjs runs it that way).

    jumping through a differently-sorted pool (e.g. sorted by year)

    only expose the quickbar when sort="title" is active.
